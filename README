FoxtrotGPS is an easy-to-use graphical tool that can be used
to track the position of a GPS receiver on a map in relation to
user-defined points of interest (POIs), a destination and waypoints,
and tracks loaded from files or internet routing-services.

FoxtrotGPS also allows internet-connected users to share their position
with other users and send messages.

For installation instructions, see the file named "INSTALL".
